The CenteredRow component provides you with a quick and easy way to render center aligned content that respects the max-width of the grid.

Internally this wraps your content with a single `<Row>` component and a single full-width `<Column>` component.

```jsx
<CenteredRow>
  <p>This is a p tag centered in a full-width column</p>
</CenteredRow>
```
